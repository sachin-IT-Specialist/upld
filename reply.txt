That’s completely understandable — and you’re not overreacting.

When people who **don’t support you** (and maybe even *enjoy* seeing you uncomfortable) start asking questions like:

* “How much do you make now?”
* “Did you finally get a job?”
* “Still unemployed?”
* “What company would even hire you?”

…they’re not being curious — they’re being **passive-aggressive**, judgmental, and intrusive.

You *don’t owe them anything* — not your job title, not your salary, not even your time.

## 🔹 Here Are Some Powerful, Polite Ways to Respond

### ✅ **Short & Firm (no explanation)**

These shut it down **without making a scene**:

* “I’d rather not talk about money.”
* “I keep that private.”
* “That’s between me and my employer.”

If they keep going:

* “I’ve said I’m not comfortable sharing that.”

---

### ✅ **Flip It Back on Them**

If you’re feeling confident, throw the awkwardness back where it belongs:

* “Why are you asking?”
* “That’s a bit personal, isn’t it?”
* “You ask that like it’s your business.”

Said calmly, these make them squirm — and signal that you’re *not intimidated anymore*.

---

### ✅ **Humorous Deflection (if you're not ready to confront)**

This avoids the question while keeping your cool:

* “Not enough to retire yet!”
* “Same as everyone else: not enough!”
* “When I hit billionaire status, I’ll send a press release.”

Humor can help *you* stay calm while making *them* feel off balance.

## 🔹 Important: You Don’t Have to Defend Your Worth

People who have opposed you in the past often *want* to measure your value by your job or income — but that says more about *them* than you.

Your worth isn't up for discussion, especially not by people who enjoy seeing you uncomfortable.

## Want to Practice a Reply?

If you tell me exactly what someone said to you — word for word or close to it — I can help you write a **natural-sounding reply** that’s:

* Calm
* Confident
* Non-confrontational (but still protective)

Would that help you feel more prepared next time it happens?


Thanks for sharing that — it's a tough situation, especially when **family dynamics**, **power roles** (like your cousin being a pastor), and **public shaming** are all in the mix.

Let’s break this into two parts — one for each person — and how you can handle them both **strategically** and with **dignity**.

---

## 🔹 1. Your **Cousin (the Pastor)** — Passive-Aggressive Remarks

### 🧠 The Dynamic:

* Being a **pastor** gives them *social power* and *moral authority*, so their comments can be coated in fake concern or humor — but still carry judgment.
* They may make veiled digs (“Did your wife make you silent?”) to undermine your confidence while keeping their hands clean.

---

### 🛠 How to Handle:

#### ✅ Option 1: **Call It Gently but Publicly (if appropriate)**

> “That’s an odd question for a funeral, don’t you think?”

This subtly highlights the inappropriateness of the comment without being aggressive.

#### ✅ Option 2: **Private Conversation (Best for Long-Term Impact)**

> “I’ve noticed sometimes you say things in a joking way that feel more like criticism. I’d appreciate it if we could speak more directly and respectfully, especially during sensitive moments.”

This is calm, non-accusatory, but powerful.

#### ✅ Option 3: **Mirror It With a Neutral Tone**

> “No, I’m quiet because I’m reflecting — it’s a funeral, not a talk show.”

It exposes the absurdity of their question without being overly confrontational.

---

## 🔹 2. Your **Uncle** — Public Humiliation Over Health

### 🧠 The Dynamic:

* Publicly asking about your health in a humiliating way is a form of **social dominance** — it makes you look vulnerable while they appear superior or “concerned.”
* He may wrap it in “just asking” or “I care,” but his real motive is control or shaming.

---

### 🛠 How to Handle:

#### ✅ Option 1: **Shut It Down Politely But Firmly**

> “I’d prefer to keep health matters private, especially in a setting like this.”

Delivers a boundary without making a scene.

#### ✅ Option 2: **Turn It Around (Without Playing His Game)**

> “Why do you ask?” *(Tone: Calm, not confrontational)*

This puts the pressure on **him** to justify why he’s asking. Most passive-aggressive people will back off when confronted like this.

#### ✅ Option 3: **Use Humor to Disarm**

> “Well, I was doing okay until the health interrogation started.”

This makes your point without escalating things.

## 💡 Long-Term Strategy for Both

| Step                                                          | What to Do                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧱 **Set Emotional Boundaries**                               | Limit how much personal info you share with them.     |
| 🎭 **Don’t React Publicly**                                   | Stay calm and collected — they often want a reaction. |
| 🪞 **Reflect Their Behavior**                                 | “That sounded more like a judgment than concern.”     |
| 🧍‍♂️ **Limit Access to Your Personal Life**                  | The less ammo they have, the less they can use.       |
| ☎️ **Private Talks (Only If They’re Capable of Hearing You)** | Try once — if they dismiss or deny, don’t push.       |

---

## ✅ If You Want a Line to End the Conversation Fast:

> “Let’s talk about something else — this isn’t the time or place.”

Or:

> “I’m not going to get into that right now.”

These are powerful because:

* You don’t owe anyone an explanation.
* You stay in control of what you will and won’t discuss.
