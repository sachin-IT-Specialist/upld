I'm really sorry that happened. That's invasive, disrespectful, and incredibly unfair — especially when someone ignores your clear discomfort and keeps pressing. **Your health is private**, and *no one* has the right to demand details, especially publicly.

Let’s build you some tools to protect yourself in those moments — without having to argue, explain, or expose yourself.

---

## 🔹 If You’re Caught Off Guard

**Use short, closed responses** that show you’re not open to that discussion:

* “I don’t feel like talking about that right now.”
* “That’s personal.”
* “Not something I want to get into.”

And then: **go quiet, change the topic, or look away.** Let *them* sit in the awkward silence. That’s power.

## 🔹 If They Keep Pushing

You can escalate slightly without raising your voice:

* “I’ve already said I don’t want to talk about it.”
* “Please respect my privacy.”
* “Why are you so interested in this?”

That last one flips the spotlight back on *them*. Often, these people expect you to feel small — not to challenge them back.

## 🔹 If You Want to Shut It Down Completely

If someone *really* won’t stop, you have every right to say:

> “This is inappropriate, and I’m done answering.”

You don't need to care how others see that — they saw the other person push past your boundaries, not you being "rude."

---

## 🔹 If You Want to Be Polite but Firm

Some people (especially introverts) prefer not to escalate at all. You can still be firm:

* “I understand you’re curious, but I’d rather not talk about it.”
* “I’m focusing on getting better, not discussing it.”

These keep your dignity intact — and still send a clear signal.

## Want Help With a Specific Line?

If you want, you can tell me exactly what they said or how it played out — I can help you craft a **go-to reply** you’ll feel confident using, either in-person or by message.

You don't have to put up with that again. Let’s make sure next time, you’re ready.
